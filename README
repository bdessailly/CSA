CSA

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it to get an idea of the module's uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.

TO DO

  + Change code so that equivalent positions between equivalent 
    domains (see option -e of script dom_to_csares) are transferred 
    based on alignments of the equivalent domains, rather than 
    simply on residue position strings from the PDB files as it is 
    done at the moment. In a few cases, this is risky behaviour as 
    residue positions can sometimes be different for equivalent 
    residues in different PDB entries (e.g. 1004 in one PDB entry 
    would be equivalent to 4 in another PDB equivalent entry), and 
    may sometimes be the same for different residues (although I 
    don't know of specific examples of this potentially more 
    problematic situation). Using alignment would be safer but also 
    would take a longer time.
